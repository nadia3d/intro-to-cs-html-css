            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol start=01>
                <li>
                    Brown 4 tablespoons butter; let cool.
                    You can find out more about browning butter <a
                        href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-brown-butter-technique" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Whisk in sugar, eggs, then 2 cups buttermilk.
                    Sprinkle surface of batter with salt, baking powder, and baking soda and mix thoroughly (whisking it
                    a bit more than seems necessary), scraping down bowl when you’re done.
                    Add flour and stir just until combined; small to medium-sized lumps are fine.
                    If the batter seems too thick, add more buttermilk, a drizzle at a time, until you get the
                    consistency you want.
                    The thinner the batter, the flatter the pancakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat an electric griddle, if using, or place a griddle pan or other large skillet over medium heat.
                    Test your pan by sprinkling a few drops of water on it.
                    If the water bounces and spatters, the
                    griddle is hot enough.
                    Add a pat of butter to the pan and swirl it around evenly by tipping the pan
                    or by using a pastry brush.
                </li>
                <li>For 3-inch pancakes, as shown here, spoon about 2 tablespoons of batter per pancake.
                    For 6-inch pancakes, use a 4-ounce ladle or 1/2-cup measure. Pour the batter
                    in pools 2 inches apart.

                    Arrange a bunch of blueberries over the cooking pancake, pressing them in
                    slightly.

                    When the pancakes have bubbles on top and look slightly dry around the edges, about 2 1/2
                    minutes, flip each over.

                    If any batter oozes or blueberries roll out, push them back under with your
                    spatula.
                    Cook until golden underneath, about 1 to 2 more minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Transfer pancakes to a serving platter. Or, if you’d like to keep them as warm as possible, to a
                    baking sheet in a 200-degree oven.

                    Repeat the process with more butter and remaining batter.
                </li>
                <li>Serve with your favorite adornments: powdered sugar, butter, maple syrup, or none of the above.</li>
